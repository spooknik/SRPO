## 🎉 Key Features
1. **Direct Align**: We introduce a new sampling strategy for diffusion fine-tuning that can effectively restore highly noisy images, leading to an optimization process that is more stable and less computationally demanding, especially during the initial timesteps.
2. **Faster Training**:   By rolling out only a single image and optimizing directly with analytical gradients—a key distinction from GRPO—our method achieves significant performance improvements for FLUX.1.dev in under 10 minutes of training. To further accelerate the process, our method supports replacing online rollouts entirely with a small dataset of real images; we find that fewer than 1500 images are sufficient to effectively train FLUX.1.dev.
3. **Free of Reward Hacking**: We have improved the training strategy for method that direct backpropagation on reward signal (such as ReFL and DRaFT). Moreover, we directly regularize the model using negative rewards, without the need for KL divergence or a separate reward system. In our experiments, this approach achieves comparable performance with multiple different rewards, improving the perceptual quality of FLUX.1.dev without suffering from reward hacking issues, such as overfitting to color or oversaturation preferences.
4. **Potential for Controllable Fine-tuning**: For the first time in online RL, we incorporate dynamically controllable text conditions, enabling on-the-fly adjustment of reward preference towards styles within the scope of the reward model.

## 🔑 Inference

### Using ComfyUI

You can use it in [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI).

Load the following image in ComfyUI to get the workflow, or load the JSON file directly [SRPO-workflow](comfyui/SRPO-workflow.json):

Tip: The workflow JSON info was added to the image file.

![Example](comfyui/SRPO-workflow.png)

### Quick start
```bash
from diffusers import FluxPipeline
from safetensors.torch import load_file

prompt='The Death of Ophelia by John Everett Millais, Pre-Raphaelite painting, Ophelia floating in a river surrounded by flowers, detailed natural elements, melancholic and tragic atmosphere'
pipe = FluxPipeline.from_pretrained('./data/flux',
        torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,
        use_safetensors=True
    ).to("cuda")
state_dict = load_file("./srpo/diffusion_pytorch_model.safetensors")
pipe.transformer.load_state_dict(state_dict)
image = pipe(
    prompt,
    guidance_scale=3.5,
    height=1024,
    width=1024,
    num_inference_steps=50,
    max_sequence_length=512,
    generator=generator
).images[0]
```

Inference with our cases. Replace `model_path` in `vis.py`.
```bash
torchrun --nnodes=1 --nproc_per_node=8 \
    --node_rank 0 \
    --rdzv_endpoint $CHIEF_IP:29502 \
    --rdzv_id 456 \
    vis.py 
```

## 🚚 Training
### Prepare Training Model
1. Pretrain Model: download the FLUX.dev.1 checkpoints from [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev) to `./data/flux`.
```bash
mkdir data
mkdir ./data/flux
huggingface-cli login
huggingface-cli download --resume-download  black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev --local-dir ./data/flux
```
2. Reward Model: download the HPS-v2.1(HPS_v2.1_compressed.pt) and CLIP H-14 checkpoints from [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/xswu/HPSv2/tree/main) to `./hps_ckpt`.
```bash
mkdir ./data/hps_ckpt
huggingface-cli login
huggingface-cli download --resume-download xswu/HPSv2 HPS_v2.1_compressed.pt --local-dir ./data/hps_ckpt
huggingface-cli download --resume-download laion/CLIP-ViT-H-14-laion2B-s32B-b79K open_clip_pytorch_model.bin --local-dir ./data/hps_ckpt
```
3. (Optional) Reward Model: download the PickScore checkpoint from [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/yuvalkirstain/PickScore_v1) to `./data/ps`.
```bash
mkdir ./data/ps
huggingface-cli login
python ./scripts/huggingface/download_hf.py --repo_id yuvalkirstain/PickScore_v1  --local_dir ./data/ps
python ./scripts/huggingface/download_hf.py --repo_id laion/CLIP-ViT-H-14-laion2B-s32B-b79K --local_dir ./data/clip
```

### Prepare Training Data

```bash
# Write training prompts into ./prompts.txt. Note: For online RL, no image-text pairs are needed—only inference text.
via ./prompts.txt
# Pre-extract text embeddings from your custom training dataset—this boosts training efficiency.
bash scripts/preprocess/preprocess_flux_rl_embeddings.sh
cp videos2caption2.json  ./data/rl_embeddings
```

### Full-parameter Training

- HPS-v2.1 serves as the Reward Model in our reinforcement learning process.
    ```bash 
    bash scripts/finetune/SRPO_training_hpsv2.sh
    ```
- (Optional) PickScore serves as the Reward Model in our reinforcement learning process.
    ```bash
    bash scripts/finetune/SRPO_training_ps.sh
    ```
    > ⚠️ Current control words are designed for HPS-v2.1, so training with PickScore may yield suboptimal results vs. HPS due to this mismatch. 

- Run distributed training with pdsh.
  ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    echo "$NODE_IP_LIST" | tr ',' '\n' | sed 's/:8$//' | grep -v '1.1.1.1' > /tmp/pssh.hosts
    node_ip=$(paste -sd, /tmp/pssh.hosts)
    pdsh -w $node_ip "conda activate SRPO;cd <project path>; bash scripts/finetune/SRPO_training_hpsv2.sh"
  ```
### How to Support Custom Models
1. Modify `preprocess_flux_embedding.py` and `latent_flux_rl_datasets.py` to pre-extract text embeddings from your custom training dataset—this boosts training efficiency.
2. Adjust `args.vis_sampling_step` to modify sigma_schedule. Typically, this value matches the model's regular inference steps.
3. Direct-propagation needs significant GPU memory. Enabling VAE gradient checkpointing before reward calculation reduces this greatly.
4. If implementing outside FastVideo, first disable the inversion branch to check for reward hacking—its presence likely indicates correct implementation.
5. Pure Direct-Align works for SRPO-unsupported tasks (e.g., OCR, Image Editing) with minimal code changes.

### Hyperparameter Recommendations
For best results, use these settings as a starting point and adjust for your model/dataset:

1. **Batch_size**: Larger sizes generally improve quality more. For Flux.dev.1 reinforcement under current settings, 32 works well.
2. **Learning_rate**: 1e-5 to 1e-6 works for most models.
3. **Train_timestep**: Focus on early-to-middle diffusion stages. Too early (e.g., sigmas>0.99) causes structural distortions; too late encourages color-based reward hacking.
4. **Discount_inv** & **Discount_denoise**: Let discount_inv = [a, b], discount_denoise = [c, d]. Preserve structure by setting c slightly > b (avoids early layout corruption). Fix color oversaturation by setting a slightly > d (tempers aggressive tones). Current hyperparameters work for most in-house models and are a good baseline.
